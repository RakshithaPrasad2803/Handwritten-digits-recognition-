# Handwritten-digits-recognition-
Human handwriting is incredibly diverse, with some styles being easy to read while others can be challenging to interpret. This diversity reflects each person’s uniqueness and creativity. However, accurately recognizing handwritten digits is crucial for various applications, including postal services, banking, and automated data entry.

To address this, a reliable tool for recognizing handwritten digits is essential. Handwritten digit recognition enables machines to understand and classify human-written digits, a task complicated by the inherent imperfections and variability in handwriting.
In this project, we will develop and evaluate machine learning models using three different algorithms—SVM, KNN, and CNN—to determine which performs best for handwritten digit recognition.
